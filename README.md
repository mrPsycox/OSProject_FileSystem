a simple file system interface using binary files (Bitmap).
There are two blocks of type: 
- Directory blocks
- Data blocks
The file system stores these blocks reserving the first part to store the linked lists blocks (free blocks, files blocks) and
also a single global directory (root).

This project was assigned by the course of Sistemi Operativi (Operating Systems) hosted by Sapienza University of Rome.
